=System Recovery CD=
This repo contains what is nescessary for creating a PXE environment of http://www.system-rescue-cd.org

I do not maintain the contents of this repository but I have placed them here so they can at least be centralised without having to mount the ISO and pull files out of various locations in the ISO
